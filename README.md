New York City Energy & Water Performance Map

Brought to you by the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/index.page" target="_blank">Mayor's Office of Sustainability</a> and <a href="http://www.urbanintelligencelab.org/" target="_blank">Urban Intelligence Lab</a> at <a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progress</a>.
 
The NYC Energy & Water Performance Map helps us understand the energy and water efficiency of more than 26,000 buildings across New York's five boroughs.  
 
NYC's Greener Greater Buildings Plan included one of the first benchmarking ordinances passed in the US: Local Law 84 of 2009. Local Law 84 has since become a model for cities grappling with the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in buildings. This law requires private buildings over 50,000 ft2 and public sector buildings over 10,000 ft2 to report their energy and water consumption each year for public disclosure. The NYC Energy & Water Performance Map will help users analyze annual energy and water consumption data for calendar years 2013 and 2014 for all buildings covered by Local Law 84.
 
With better analytical tools, the City aims to help property owners, buyers, and tenants to factor energy, water, and greenhouse gas emissions into their real estate decision making processes.
